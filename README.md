## About

Welcome to **"Is it a Sandwich?"** , the most absurdly accurate sandwich-identifying web app (guaranteed to provide random answers). ü•™Ever argued over whether a taco is a sandwich? Wondered if a hot dog fits the "two pieces of bread with stuff in between" definition? This app is here to help‚Äî-well, kind of. Upload a photo, click submit, and behold as our advanced _random message generator_ tells you whether it's a sandwich or just another disappointment.
No image? No problem! We'll send you on a journey of existential crisis with questions like:

- "Is nothing a sandwich?"

- "If everything is a sandwich, is nothing a sandwich too?"

Remember, life is short. Eat sandwiches responsibly.
