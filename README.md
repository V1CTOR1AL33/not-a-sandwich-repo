## About
Have you ever wondered whether something is a sandwich, like a hot dog or a taco? We're here to help. This intentionally and sillily useless web app lets you upload a photo of a sandwich, and will tell you with 100% accuracy (a randomly generated answer) whether or not the image contains a sandwich. Even if you don't upload an image at all, you'll be answered with existential questions: if nothing is a sandwich, then is everything a sandwich?

## Features
Submit: Allows you to submit images.
Answers: If the answer is yes, you will be met with a randomly generated congratulations confirming that your image is a sandwich. If it is not, you will either be met with a message denying its sandwich status, or a message correcting you and stating that it is in fact a different sandwich-like object. For this feature, there is an array of phrases ("No silly, that's a ___") and an array of sandwich-like objects that get randomly paired with the phrases ("No silly, that's a burrito"). If the user uploads nothing at all, they will be met with a message acknowledging the absence of an image such as "Is nothing a sandwich?" or "Please upload something. Anything. A sandwich would be ideal."
About: Hover above the question mark button, and a modal pop-up will appear explaining what the website does.
