## About
Have you ever wondered whether something is a sandwich, like a hot dog or a taco? We're here to help. This intentionally and sillily useless web app lets you upload a photo of a sandwich, and will tell you with 100% accuracy (a randomly generated answer) whether or not the image contains a sandwich. Even if you don't upload an image at all, you'll be answered with existential questions: if nothing is a sandwich, then is everything a sandwich?

## Features
Submit: Allows you to submit images.
Answers: After upload, you will be met with a randomly generated message. You will receive either a congratulations confirming that your image is a sandwich, a message politely denying its sandwich status, or an impartial message of defeat ("who cares anymore?"). If the user uploads nothing at all, they will be met with a message acknowledging the absence of an image such as "Is nothing a sandwich?" or "Please upload something. Anything. A sandwich would be ideal."
About: Hover above the question mark button, and a modal pop-up will appear explaining what the website does.
